Hello world, My name is Kuncoro Adjie.
Simple person who love typing.

I use [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu) everyday on my potato laptop. The distro that I use is arch linux with [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as its window manager which previously I used [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) and [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/).

I'm currently starting to explore the front-end of the web.

Thanks for dropping by.
